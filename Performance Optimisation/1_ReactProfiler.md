React Profiler:
----------------
is a tool in React DevTools that helps identify performance issues. It shows how long each componenttakes to render, how often it re-renders, and why it re-rendered—like due to prop or state changes. Iuse it to detect unnecessary re-renders and then optimize using techniques like React.memo, useCallback,or React.lazy for code splitting. It really helps in fine-tuning performance, especially in large appswith deeply nested components.”

✅ Bonus: Add a real example (if asked)
“In one of my projects, I noticed a list component was re-rendering on every parent update. Using the Profiler, I spotted it quickly and wrapped the component with React.memo, which reduced re-renders and improved responsiveness.”
