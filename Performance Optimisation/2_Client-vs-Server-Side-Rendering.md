Client side Rendering vs Server Side Rendering
------------------------------------------------

* Server is the part of our backend and client is more of what we see in front of it.
* Client side rendering means an app which is compeletely being rendered on the browser.
* React allows us to create client rendered appliction.
* We can take the example of fetching the data from the API's
* But what is client render means - right click and go to the view page source. All the data coming from API display on the browser but we can not see in the view page source / in the HTML document. We just have the div ID root.
* All the data rendered in the element tab is not useful for us because Google is not able to crawl this data and hence website won't be ranked on Google search results because you know if lets see if we are showcasing iPhone9 or lets say Samsung universe 9 device in our website. If someone searches this on Google, they won't be able to find that product exists on our website because Google search engines can not crawl it . This is an example of a client rendered application.
