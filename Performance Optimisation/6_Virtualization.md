So there's a very popular interview question which is very frequently asked from the senior developers is that suppose your given a very long list of data, for example, 1 million items to be rendered in your app. So how will you effectively render it without compromising the performance? 

So over here you can see we have this long list of data, right? If I inspect it, you can see And all of this data is rendered at once. Now, imagine if this data was, I don't know, something like 10, 000 items, or 100, 000 or even one million items. How will you render it, effectively? Now, some of you might say, yeah, we will just implement the pagination that we saw in the machine coding section. Yep, that's right. Or we will implement the infinite scrolling, but I'll tell you the new tactic that a lot of companies use these days. A lot of big tech companies use these days is virtualization and this is what the interviewer always wants to hear from you. I mean, you can explain them that you're going to be using Infinite scrolling by using throttling Etc. Right? But if there's so much of the data that has to be rendered in the front end, like we have the detaine the front end, we have to render it in in a browser. Our GPU might get slowed. Right? So to render something like this, we have to use a technique called virtualization. Now, what the hell is virtualization? Let's search Google So virtualization react okay. So if I go to images, this right, this right here. Yeah, this is a good representation of virtualization.

It has the data that has been rendered, just like this on our page, but after virtualizing this list, This is how it will look like. So this is our Dom and this is the data that is visible and it will only render the data that is visible on our screen and will not render the data that is not visible. But as soon as we start scrolling, it will render this data as well. So let's let's let me give you an a much better example. So there's a library called react window.
