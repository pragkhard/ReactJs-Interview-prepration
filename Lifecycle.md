**Can you explain the React component lifecycle?**
--------------------------------------------------

Yes. The React component lifecycle refers to the different phases a component goes through from creation to removal. These phases include:

1. **Mounting** – when the component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
2. **Updating** – when the component is re-rendered due to changes in state or props.
3. **Unmounting** – when the component is removed from the DOM.

In class components, we have some methods for handling the lifecycle methods like:

* `componentDidMount()` – called after the component is mounted/created.
* `componentDidUpdate()` – called after the component updates.
* `componentWillUnmount()` – called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed.

These methods are often used to perform tasks such as API calls, event listeners, or cleanup operations.

As we know In functional components does not have the lifecycle methods, React provides the `useEffect` hook to handle lifecycle events. It combines the functionality of all the above lifecycle methods in one unified hook.

* When you provide an empty dependency array (`[]`) to `useEffect`, the code inside it runs once, similar to `componentDidMount`.
* When you pass a specific state or prop in the dependency array, the effect runs every time that value changes, mimicking `componentDidUpdate`.
* To simulate `componentWillUnmount`, you return a cleanup function from inside the `useEffect`. This function runs when the component is unmounted.
