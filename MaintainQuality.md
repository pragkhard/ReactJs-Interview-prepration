To maintain the quality and consistency of code in my React projects-

I follow a combination of tools, best practices, coding standards, testing practices, and deployment, deployment strategies throughout the development lifecycle.

* During development, I actively use tools like the **React Developer Tools** - It has Component & React Profiler to inspect that we monitor levele of JSX, props, state, and optimize performance by identifying unnecessary re-renders. 

* If I’m working with Redux, I rely on **Redux DevTools** monitor the flow of actions and ensure state is updated correctly. I also use inbuilt **browser dev tools like** - Lighthouse, Network tab, Local Storage / Session Storage viewer for checking performance, accessibility, and SEO metrics.

* For Improve the code quality we are using Static analysis tool like - 
ESLint - Find errors in code
Prettier - Auto formate
Typescript - Types error

Pre commit hooks - (which run checks before every commit.)
Husky
lint-staged

* For accessibility, I ensure semantic HTML is used correctly 
and test screen-reader compatibility using tools like NVDA, VoiceOver, axe DevTools, Color Contrast Checker – Tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker.  

I also refer to guidelines like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and use ARIA attributes where needed to ensure the application is accessible to all users.

* To maintain consistent formatting and catch common errors early, I use **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for automatic formatting. To ensure that no code goes into the repository without proper formatting or linting, I integrate **Husky and lint-staged**, which run checks before every commit.

After development, I focus heavily on testing. I use **React Testing Library** and **Jest** to write unit and integration tests that simulate real user behavior. We maintain a **code coverage target of over 80%**, and for API-based components, I sometimes use **Mock Service Worker** (MSW) to mock backend responses in tests.

We also follow a disciplined **code review process** using pull requests in GitHub. Along with manual review, we integrate **SonarQube** to automatically scan the codebase for vulnerabilities, code smells, and coverage gaps.

For version control and collaboration, we use **Git and GitHub** with branching strategies like feature and hotfix branches. Our **CI/CD pipeline is managed via Jenkins**, where every push goes through automated build, test, and deployment stages. Deployment is usually done via **AWS**, using services like S3 or EC2 depending on the project requirements.

Lastly, from a structural perspective, we keep our codebase modular and reusable by following a clean **folder structure** based on features or atomic design principles. This helps in maintainability and collaboration across teams.

Overall, it’s not just about using tools — it's about combining them with good practices to ensure the application is performant, reliable, accessible, and easy to scale.
