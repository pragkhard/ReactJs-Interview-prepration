Difference between package.json & package-lock.json-
=======================================================

package.json-
----------------
Main purpose of package.json is to define project dependencies, name and version and it also contain scripts and metadata, It keeps the approx. version and it is editable by developers, editable minor version and major version. minor versions represent by * Caret sign (^) and major version is represent by Tilde sign (~)

package-lock.json-
---------------------
keeps the exact version of dependencies ensuring that whatever version is installed on my development machine is the same version used in the productions, locking the dependency version so that same version are used in both development and production, it is auto generated when we running npm installed should not be manually editable. 
"Imagine youâ€™re working on a React project. You install react@18.2.0, and your teammate installs react@18.3.0 because of flexible versioning (^18.2.0). Now, your code works fine, but your teammate faces unexpected bugs due to breaking changes in the new version. This inconsistency can cause major issues in production."
âœ… Solution: package.json defines the required dependencies, while package-lock.json ensures everyone installs the exact same versions, preventing version mismatches and unexpected bugs. ðŸš€
