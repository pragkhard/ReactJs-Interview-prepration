React
========
React, is an open-source JavaScript library .It is used for building single-page applications. It means application looks like a single page and not reload and refresh on jumping on the other page and links.  Its Developed and maintained by Facebook. 

Main feature of reactjs- 
-------------------------
React, is an open-source JavaScript library .It is used for building single-page applications. It focuses on component-based development, utilizes a virtual DOM for performance optimization, allows JSX , enforces unidirectional data flow, It also supports mobile app development through React Native and benefits from an active and supportive community. 
 
JSX
-----
JSX (JavaScript XML) in React.js is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript files.  
JSX makes React code more readable and intuitive. 
During compilation, JSX is transformed into JavaScript code, enabling the creation of React elements for rendering on web pages/ enabling React to render components efficiently.

Difference between props and state- 
---------------------------------------
Both props and state are plain javascript object. Both of them hold information, they are different  in their functionality with respect to component. 

* Props are passing data from one component to another component where as in state data is not      accessible outside from component. 

* Props are Immutable cannot be changed directly within the component. State are  mutable can be changed using this.setState() in class components or state hooks in functional components. 

* In respect of data flow Props are Unidirectional passing data from parent to child components. State are Unidirectional changes trigger re-renders within the component. 

Unique Key id while using map-
--------------------------------

*   Each item in the list must be uniquely identified
    DOM is going to re-render all the components again. As DOM canâ€™t identify where to place it. But if we give each of them a unique ID then react knows where to put that component according to the ID. It is a good optimization and performance thing. Note* Never use index as keys in map. It is not recommended.

*   named exports, you have to write curly braces and then whatever you need to import.
*   If we use default export, then no need to use curly bracket at the time of import.
