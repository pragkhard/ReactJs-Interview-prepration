Virtual DOM
------------
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When there are changes in a React component React first updates the Virtual DOM instead of the real DOM directly, it calculate the difference between updated Virtual DOM with the previous version. Once the calculations are done,then the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed. The entire process called reconciliation. 

This process improve the performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders and DOM manipulations and enhancing the application's speed and efficiency.

In-memory representation refers to how React converts UI components into JavaScript objects.

React is widely used nowadays instead of Angular or Vue. What are the main features or benefits of React that make developers prefer it?
--------------------------------
* React is widely adopted because of its simplicity, flexibility, and performance compared to Angular. One of the key differences is that React is a library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular. This gives developers the freedom to choose their own tools for routing, state management, and APIs instead of following a strict structure.

* React uses a virtual DOM, which makes UI updates faster and more efficient & improving performance, especially in large applications. Angular uses a real DOM and change detection system, which can become slower as the app grows.

* React also follows a unidirectional data flow, making data management and debugging more predictable. Angular, in contrast, supports two-way data binding, which can introduce complexity in larger apps.

* Another big advantage is that React uses JSX – allowing developers to write HTML inside JavaScript – which feels more intuitive and keeps logic and UI tightly coupled. Angular separates logic (TypeScript) and templates (HTML), which some developers find less seamless.

* Lastly, React has a larger ecosystem and community, with massive adoption in the industry and better support for third-party libraries.
